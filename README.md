## Please note
The current version of the tool utilizes some minified JavaScript and CSS code from the original [Text2MindMap.com](http://www.text2mindmap.com), which I didn't personally write. This was originally just meant to be a quick hack for personal use, but seeing as this project has gotten a lot of interest, I'm planning on replacing the old code with something I've written myself. This should let me properly license the code and later extend the functionality of the site. Stay tuned!

# Text2MindMap
An online tool for making mindmaps by writing indented lists.

A few months ago one of my favorite tools [Text2MindMap](http://www.text2mindmap.com) went down and since there doesn't seem to be any plans to bring it back up I created my own version of the site. It's basically just a quick mashup between some of the code from the original site and some code from my [Markdown Editor](https://tobloef.com/markant/), but I hope someone will find it as useful.
